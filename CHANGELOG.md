## Event build log

## 2026-10-13T11:06:45+05:30 — Context-noise diagnosis and opt-in section relevance filtering

- Changed: Added `RetrievalService.last_diagnostics` (bounded, content-free stage trace) and `eval/diagnose.py`; section-only semantic margin (`CELESTIN_SEMANTIC_SECTION_MARGIN`, shared `semantic/margin.py`), optional section top-K cap (`CELESTIN_SECTION_TOP_K`) and query-focused excerpts (`CELESTIN_SECTION_EXCERPT_BYTES`) in `retrieval/relevance.py`; evaluation `--noise-sweep` and `--dataset heldout` with a frozen held-out set (`eval/heldout.py`) and answers-lost reporting. No defaults changed; MCP tools and schemas unchanged.
- Why: 90% of section items in the context were irrelevant because weak semantic neighbours pass the 0.6 cut-off and the budget is filled in rank order.
- Validation: see the test counts in the final report; sweeps run on the dev and held-out sets. Section margin 0.08 lost no answer on either set and cut 22-35% of bytes; top-K and excerpts lost answers and are not recommended.
- Limitations: 24 documentation questions on one corpus; the margin depends on the embedding model's similarity scale; no real-LLM evidence; duplicate suppression and budget-aware packing were not implemented because the diagnosis showed no duplicates and no usable relevance signal.

## 2026-10-13T10:31:53+05:30 — Heading-section retrieval, strategy interface and adaptive selector

- Changed: Heading-section retrieval is now a product path (`celestin-docs` store gains an external-content FTS5 index and section embeddings as a third vector kind; `celestin-index` and `celestin-docs` keep them in step). New `retrieval/strategies.py` (FTS5, semantic, sections, PageIndex behind one `Candidate`/`StrategyResult` interface) and `retrieval/selector.py` (deterministic primary + one fallback); `RetrievalService.retrieve_context` now runs strategies and fuses candidates (BM25 kept for FTS-only). `CELESTIN_RETRIEVAL_SELECTOR=adaptive` opts in (default `all`); `CELESTIN_DOC_SECTIONS=0` disables sections. The FTS tier logic is shared (`tiered_match`). Eval harness gains systems H, S, SN, Sd, median bytes, fallback and strategy counts.
- Why: Make the strongest measured baseline (heading sections) available in the product and test whether routing helps.
- Validation: see the test counts in the final report below; evaluation rerun on the frozen corpus (dataset hash unchanged). The adaptive selector matched H on answer-in-context (0.92) with one strategy fewer and did not reduce context size.
- Limitations: Selector rules were revised after failure analysis on the same 12 questions; no real-LLM evidence; an LLM selector was assessed and not built. A behavior change: users who already ran `celestin-docs index` now also get section results unless `CELESTIN_DOC_SECTIONS=0`.

## 2026-10-12T22:16:12+05:30 — Trustworthy evaluation, bounded FTS5 relaxation, PageIndex routing, cost instrumentation and maintenance

- Changed: `eval/run_eval.py` rewritten (frozen corpus in `eval/corpus/`, hashed dataset, per-query records, failure/timeout counts, observed vs estimated tokens, cost estimate, run metadata, real-LLM system N with credential checks, F selectivity sweep, `--fts-relax`); bounded FTS5 relaxation (stopword tier, then OR tier with a 60% threshold and required identifiers; quoted phrases; `CELESTIN_FTS_RELAX=0` disables); optional `CELESTIN_SEMANTIC_RELATIVE_MARGIN`; deterministic PageIndex routing policy with a cheap first stage; navigation stats, bounded retries and a project/index-version-keyed cache; bold-only-heading fix (tree schema v2); `celestin-docs prune|rebuild` and deleted-source reporting; WAL for the document store; Orbit skill text renamed to Celestin (skill id `orbit` kept). PDF support assessed and deferred.
- Why: Make retrieval measurements trustworthy and cut unnecessary navigation cost while keeping PageIndex optional and off by default.
- Validation: with all extras 275 passed, 2 skipped (opt-in real-model and live-LLM tests); without extras 196 passed, 14 skipped. Evaluation rerun on the frozen corpus: strict-FTS results reproduce the first evaluation at budget 20,000; relaxation lifted the existing pipeline (answer rate 0.00 to 0.67, chat recall 0.20 to 0.80).
- Limitations: Still no real-LLM run (no credentials), so PageIndex's real quality, latency and cost are unmeasured and the strongest measured practical baseline remains section-level semantic retrieval. Relaxation thresholds and routing rules were tuned on 12 questions. A real Codex session was not tested.

## 2026-10-12T21:38:30+05:30 — Optional PageIndex document retrieval

- Changed: Added `src/orbit/pageindex/` (Markdown section trees via PageIndex's parser, separate rebuildable store, LLM outline navigator, backend, `celestin-docs` CLI), a `document_section` record kind, and PageIndex routing/fusion in `RetrievalService.retrieve_context`. `retrieve_context` responses show `source` for sections and `retrieval.pageindex` when enabled; no tool contracts changed. New extra `pageindex`. Added `eval/` (dataset, runner, results) and `docs/pageindex.md`. Test isolation fix: tests set `orbit.database.engine.DB_PATH` because it is read at import time.
- Why: Evaluate hierarchical document retrieval for long documents that chat-message storage and whole-record budgeting handle poorly.
- Validation: with all extras, 216 passed and 2 skipped (opt-in real-model and live-LLM tests). Without optional extras, 150 passed and 9 skipped. The stdio server was exercised with PageIndex enabled but unconfigured (all five tools worked). `python eval/run_eval.py` ran (results in `eval/results.md`).
- Limitations: No LLM API key was available, so navigation quality is unmeasured; the evaluation uses a lexical stand-in and an oracle upper bound and shows no evidence yet that PageIndex beats simple section chunking with the existing semantic search. Markdown only; conversations are not indexed by PageIndex by design. `.agents/skills/orbit/SKILL.md` still uses the Orbit name (not changed here).

## 2026-10-11T22:17:11+05:30 — Push reconciled branch to the fork

- Changed: Pushed merge commit `441cb0a` to `origin/main` (`67ddd33..441cb0a`) and set local `main` to track the fork.
- Why: Publish the reconciled histories to the fork so the branch can continue from the synchronized base.
- Validation: Git reported a successful push and configured `origin/main` as the tracking branch.
- Limitations: No application code changed; no application tests were run for this Git and documentation update.

## 2026-10-11T21:57:40+05:30 — Reconcile fork history and integrate the memory skill

- Changed: Merged the three upstream commits into the four-commit Celestin branch, preserving both histories; integrated `.agents/skills/orbit/SKILL.md` and its `AGENTS.md`/README guidance, combined both development logs, and aligned the README's MCP inspection command with the configured `celestin` server name.
- Why: Bring the fork up to date while retaining the Celestin rename and semantic retrieval work already on the branch.
- Validation: Reviewed the merge tree and documentation consistency; `git diff --check` and local Markdown link checks run after resolution. No tests run for this Git and documentation change.
- Limitations: The request did not specify another application feature, so no application code was changed. The repository still has no canonical project identifier for the memory skill.

## 2026-10-11T20:20:22+05:30 — Rename to Celestin and add hybrid semantic retrieval

- Changed: Renamed the product to Celestin (distribution `celestin-memory` 0.2.0, commands `celestin` and `celestin-index`, MCP server name and `ping` text, README and docs). The `orbit` and `memory-bridge` commands, the `orbit` import package, all MCP tool names, the SQLite schema and `MEMORY_BRIDGE_DB_PATH` are kept for compatibility; `CELESTIN_DB_PATH` takes precedence when set. Added an opt-in semantic layer (`src/orbit/semantic/`: fastembed provider, sqlite-vec index in a separate file, reconciliation indexer, `celestin-index` CLI) and Reciprocal Rank Fusion in `RetrievalService` (`src/orbit/retrieval/hybrid.py`). Enabled with `CELESTIN_SEMANTIC_SEARCH=1`; when enabled, tool responses gain a `retrieval` object (`mode`, `warnings`). Tests now locate console scripts next to the interpreter, so they pass without activating the venv.
- Why: Rebrand the product and let reworded queries find saved memories without losing exact FTS5 matching.
- Validation: Full suite with the semantic extra: 171 passed, 1 skipped (opt-in real-model test). The real-model test passed separately with `CELESTIN_RUN_MODEL_TESTS=1`. A venv without the extra: all non-semantic tests passed and the semantic tests skipped. A manual run against a disposable database with the real model found the reworded memory, kept the exact error-code match first, excluded other projects, and returned nothing for an unrelated query.
- Limitations: No plugin manifest, marketplace entry or skill exists in the repository, so none was renamed. The similarity cut-off (0.6) comes from a small probe of one model and should be tuned. No MCP tool approves decisions, so approved decisions need `celestin-index sync`. Not tested on Windows/macOS. Vector search is brute-force. Remote embedding providers are not implemented. Historical entries below keep the Orbit name.

## 2026-10-11T09:11:48+05:30 — Add reusable Orbit project-memory skill

- Changed: Added `.agents/skills/orbit/SKILL.md`, guidance in `AGENTS.md`, and README setup, invocation, and teammate instructions.
- Why: Give Codex a reusable workflow for safe project-scoped retrieval and explicitly approved saves through the existing Orbit MCP tools.
- Validation: Skill metadata validator passed; `python -m pytest -p no:cacheprovider -o addopts=''` on the rebased branch: 107 passed; `git diff --check` clean.
- Limitations: No canonical project identifier is documented for this repository. This adds no project ID, MCP configuration, credentials, or per-user authorization.

## 2026-10-11T09:06:01+05:30 — Align README with the implemented project

- Changed: Rewrote `README.md` with cross-platform installation, database configuration, Codex CLI setup, MCP tool examples, and current behavior and limitations.
- Why: The previous setup was Windows-only and omitted important implementation details for running and demonstrating Orbit.
- Validation: Compared instructions against `pyproject.toml`, the SQLite engine, MCP server, and retrieval documentation; checked Markdown links and `git diff --check`.
- Limitations: No application UI or hosted demo is implemented; the demo uses a connected local MCP client.

## 2026-10-11T05:18:21+05:30 — Validate end-to-end MCP memory workflow

- Changed: Added a two-process stdio MCP integration test using a disposable SQLite database; fixed FastMCP error wrapping so `SOURCE_MESSAGE_NOT_FOUND` keeps its stable category over the protocol.
- Why: Validate persistence across a server restart, cross-session retrieval, project scoping, lifecycle filtering, and the public error envelope without touching project data.
- Validation: `python -m pytest -p no:cacheprovider -o addopts=''` — 107 passed; `git diff --check` — clean. The focused test also passed independently.
- Limitations: No authenticated identity or identity-to-project authorization exists. `project` remains a caller-selected scope; current isolation prevents cross-project record mixing but does not authorize callers. Decision approval was performed through the repository in the test fixture because no approval MCP tool exists.

## Template setup — 10 October 2026

- Changed: Added the event README, rules, agent guide, change log, AI usage record, submission checklist, Git ignore rules, and pull request checklist.
- Why: Give participants a consistent starting point for event rules, basic coding patterns, documented changes, and regular commits.
- Validation: Checked local Markdown links, event detail consistency, required documents, and diff whitespace before publishing.
- Limitations: Documentation scaffolding only; no participant project, application, or working demo is included. GitHub publication and template status are verified separately after creation.
