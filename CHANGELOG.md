## Event build log

## 2026-10-11T22:17:11+05:30 — Push reconciled branch to the fork

- Changed: Pushed merge commit `441cb0a` to `origin/main` (`67ddd33..441cb0a`) and set local `main` to track the fork.
- Why: Publish the reconciled histories to the fork so the branch can continue from the synchronized base.
- Validation: Git reported a successful push and configured `origin/main` as the tracking branch.
- Limitations: No application code changed; no application tests were run for this Git and documentation update.

## 2026-10-11T21:57:40+05:30 — Reconcile fork history and integrate the memory skill

- Changed: Merged the three upstream commits into the four-commit Celestin branch, preserving both histories; integrated `.agents/skills/orbit/SKILL.md` and its `AGENTS.md`/README guidance, combined both development logs, and aligned the README's MCP inspection command with the configured `celestin` server name.
- Why: Bring the fork up to date while retaining the Celestin rename and semantic retrieval work already on the branch.
- Validation: Reviewed the merge tree and documentation consistency; `git diff --check` and local Markdown link checks run after resolution. No tests run for this Git and documentation change.
- Limitations: The request did not specify another application feature, so no application code was changed. The repository still has no canonical project identifier for the memory skill.

## 2026-10-11T20:20:22+05:30 — Rename to Celestin and add hybrid semantic retrieval

- Changed: Renamed the product to Celestin (distribution `celestin-memory` 0.2.0, commands `celestin` and `celestin-index`, MCP server name and `ping` text, README and docs). The `orbit` and `memory-bridge` commands, the `orbit` import package, all MCP tool names, the SQLite schema and `MEMORY_BRIDGE_DB_PATH` are kept for compatibility; `CELESTIN_DB_PATH` takes precedence when set. Added an opt-in semantic layer (`src/orbit/semantic/`: fastembed provider, sqlite-vec index in a separate file, reconciliation indexer, `celestin-index` CLI) and Reciprocal Rank Fusion in `RetrievalService` (`src/orbit/retrieval/hybrid.py`). Enabled with `CELESTIN_SEMANTIC_SEARCH=1`; when enabled, tool responses gain a `retrieval` object (`mode`, `warnings`). Tests now locate console scripts next to the interpreter, so they pass without activating the venv.
- Why: Rebrand the product and let reworded queries find saved memories without losing exact FTS5 matching.
- Validation: Full suite with the semantic extra: 171 passed, 1 skipped (opt-in real-model test). The real-model test passed separately with `CELESTIN_RUN_MODEL_TESTS=1`. A venv without the extra: all non-semantic tests passed and the semantic tests skipped. A manual run against a disposable database with the real model found the reworded memory, kept the exact error-code match first, excluded other projects, and returned nothing for an unrelated query.
- Limitations: No plugin manifest, marketplace entry or skill exists in the repository, so none was renamed. The similarity cut-off (0.6) comes from a small probe of one model and should be tuned. No MCP tool approves decisions, so approved decisions need `celestin-index sync`. Not tested on Windows/macOS. Vector search is brute-force. Remote embedding providers are not implemented. Historical entries below keep the Orbit name.

## 2026-10-11T09:11:48+05:30 — Add reusable Orbit project-memory skill

- Changed: Added `.agents/skills/orbit/SKILL.md`, guidance in `AGENTS.md`, and README setup, invocation, and teammate instructions.
- Why: Give Codex a reusable workflow for safe project-scoped retrieval and explicitly approved saves through the existing Orbit MCP tools.
- Validation: Skill metadata validator passed; `python -m pytest -p no:cacheprovider -o addopts=''` on the rebased branch: 107 passed; `git diff --check` clean.
- Limitations: No canonical project identifier is documented for this repository. This adds no project ID, MCP configuration, credentials, or per-user authorization.

## 2026-10-11T09:06:01+05:30 — Align README with the implemented project

- Changed: Rewrote `README.md` with cross-platform installation, database configuration, Codex CLI setup, MCP tool examples, and current behavior and limitations.
- Why: The previous setup was Windows-only and omitted important implementation details for running and demonstrating Orbit.
- Validation: Compared instructions against `pyproject.toml`, the SQLite engine, MCP server, and retrieval documentation; checked Markdown links and `git diff --check`.
- Limitations: No application UI or hosted demo is implemented; the demo uses a connected local MCP client.

## 2026-10-11T05:18:21+05:30 — Validate end-to-end MCP memory workflow

- Changed: Added a two-process stdio MCP integration test using a disposable SQLite database; fixed FastMCP error wrapping so `SOURCE_MESSAGE_NOT_FOUND` keeps its stable category over the protocol.
- Why: Validate persistence across a server restart, cross-session retrieval, project scoping, lifecycle filtering, and the public error envelope without touching project data.
- Validation: `python -m pytest -p no:cacheprovider -o addopts=''` — 107 passed; `git diff --check` — clean. The focused test also passed independently.
- Limitations: No authenticated identity or identity-to-project authorization exists. `project` remains a caller-selected scope; current isolation prevents cross-project record mixing but does not authorize callers. Decision approval was performed through the repository in the test fixture because no approval MCP tool exists.

## Template setup — 10 October 2026

- Changed: Added the event README, rules, agent guide, change log, AI usage record, submission checklist, Git ignore rules, and pull request checklist.
- Why: Give participants a consistent starting point for event rules, basic coding patterns, documented changes, and regular commits.
- Validation: Checked local Markdown links, event detail consistency, required documents, and diff whitespace before publishing.
- Limitations: Documentation scaffolding only; no participant project, application, or working demo is included. GitHub publication and template status are verified separately after creation.
